((addressee))

I am getting constant messages from my Bank and phone company to link my Aadhaar number. There are reports on a daily basis about the shoddy implementation of Aadhaar and how it is putting my personal information in danger.

If one does a cursory google search, there is enough material about the pitfalls of Aadhaar being reported. From starvation deaths[^1] to exclusion[^2] to enabling fraud[^3] to mass surveillance[^4], Aadhaar is becoming the basis for a lot of widespread suffering. There have been data leaks by 210 government entities[^5] putting privacy of citizens like me at risk and making them vulnerable to identity theft[^6].

As my representative, I request you to raise these issues regarding Aadhaar in Parliament. I ask you to demand an answer from the Government of the day as to why I am being forced to register for a flawed system. I demand that Aadhaar should be made non-mandatory, as the Supreme Court has already ordered in 2015, and there should be an opt-out clause which would allow those who donâ€™t want to be a part of the system to get out.

Please go to this link for a draft Rule 193 Notice[^7] with an explanatory statement asking for a Short Duration discussion on citizen concerns regarding Aadhaar. You can download any of the notices and file them according to your convenience.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
