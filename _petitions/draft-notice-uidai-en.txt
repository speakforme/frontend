We are shocked that you have been continuing to service authentication and KYC requests for UID numbers and provide associated data for purposes beyond that approved by the Supreme Court of India. This is an unbelievable disrespect of the rule of law and of the repeated orders of the Supreme Court of India.

Your actions are resulting in coercing children, elderly and others alike to have to register for an UID number against their free will. Your actions also constitute an illegal functional creep that cannot be morally or legally justified. Your actions reek of creating a fait accompli before the court finally decides on the matter and hence does not uphold the promise of justice, liberty, equality or fraternity.

We draw you're attention to the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s orders of 11 August 2015 restricting the use of Aadhaar to PDS Scheme, the distribution of foodgrains, and cooking fuel, such as kerosene and LPG. This was extended to allow its use for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), National Social Assistance Programme (Old Age Pensions, Widow Pensions, Disability Pensions) Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in its orders of 15 October 2015. The Court also stated that the information about an individual obtained by the Unique Identification Authority of India while issuing an Aadhaar card shall not be used for any other purpose. The use of the UID number/Aadhaar or information associated with it for any purposes other than that allowed by the court as well as it being mandated for any purposes not allowed by the court is a contempt of the rule of law and the orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

We require that you:

1. Immediately cease providing any authentication and/or KYC or support and use of the UID number for purposes other than those permitted by the Supreme Court of India.

2. Cease to provide any UID authentication or KYC to any organisation mandating the use of UID number for the permitted purposes.

3. Issue notifications and wide publicity in the electronic and print media including radio and television networks, as required by the orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated August 16, 2016, to make it clear that you will not

A. Provide authentication and KYC services beyond those permitted by the Supreme Court or

B. Cause or allow any agencies to cause anyone to require registering for an UID number or

C. Allow anyone to suffer for want of it and that UID number.

We trust you will share your compliance of the orders within 7 days, publish widely your decision to abide by the orders of the Supreme Court and not cause us to seek other remedies and relief for your failure to respect the rule of law.

Sincerely yours,

CC:
