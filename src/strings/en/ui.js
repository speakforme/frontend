  email_collection_note: 'Why have we added a BCC to [email address] while sending your email? When you BCC SpeakForMe in your emails to this authority, we add it to our counter, and highlight the number of emails in our media campaigns. We will also keep you posted on any developments that need your attention. You can unsubscribe from these notices if you prefer not to be involved any further. It may become necessary to take this action further with a lawsuit, either at the local High Court level or directly to the Supreme Court. You may then be requested for participation as a litigant, and we will contact you. If the letters sent achieve their purpose, no such action will be needed. In any case, you will receive an acknowledgement mail with an unsubscribe link. We do not store the content of your email, do not share your email address with third parties, and will not be contacting you for any other matter.',
